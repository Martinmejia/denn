# Neural Networks for Differential Equations

Our main goal is to train neural networks (once) that can accurately approximate the solution to a complex
differential equation of choice with high resolution and generalization. We want to be able to use and re-use
this network to model our dynamical system.

## TODO:
1. Clean up notebooks
2. Write README
